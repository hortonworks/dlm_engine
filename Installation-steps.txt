Building & Packaging Ivory

Installing Ivory
*Pre-requisites:
   * hadoop-0.20.2 +
   * oozie-3.1.5 +

*Ivory Server

   * Download the source from https://github.com/sriksun/Ivory
   * Navigate to base project folder,named 'Ivory'
   * Build as "mvn clean package" at the base location. Please note that both maven 2/3 are supported.
   * By default only embedded/standalone mode is build.
   * To build Ivory with documentation build with MVN profile "all".
   * To build the Ivory for distributed mode, i.e. multiple server and prism mode, build with MVN profile "distributed". 
   * Once the build operation is over,navigate to '<base-folder>/Ivory/webapps/target' and deploy the .war file generated
      there in a web container (Eg: tomcat6).


*Ivory Client

   * Follow the steps 1 to 3 from server instructions.
   * Once the build operation is over, navigate to '<base-folder>/Ivory/client/target'. There is a client.jar that has
      been generated along with multiple other jars. Fetch this jar and others to use the Ivory client application.
      Please ensure that the other jars in the folder are always specified in the classpath of the client.jar.
   * Please refer Ivory-CLI guide for various options on how to use the ivory client.


*Setting up Ivory server properties:

Inside your web container, where the ivory war has exploded, you should be able to find 2 files, startup.properties and runtime.properties.
The path would be:
<container-base>/<war-location>/ivory-webapp-0.2-SNAPSHOT/WEB-INF/classes

*startup.properties:* Specifies values/paths used by Ivory on startup. Common entries usually include config store location
,broker url (for messaging), and other settings.Any changes to this requires Ivory to be restarted to take effect.

*runtime.properties:* Specifies various properties that can be picked at runtime. Ivory server keeps polling this file after a certain interval;
and incorporates changes, if any.

*Domain based settings (only applicable for Ivory 0.2):*

Ivory 0.2 and subsequent releases support domain based properties. The user can specify properties either for all domains
(with prefixing the property with a '*' ) or for a particular domain (with prefixing the domain name to the property).
Once the domain is set,  the user can set an env variable,IVORY_DOMAIN as the domain that the Ivory is supposed to use.

Example:
Trying to set the config store property for all domains:
*.config.store.uri=file:///var/lib/tomcat6/target/store
Trying to set config store property for a 'specific' domain:
qa.config.store.uri=file:///var/lib/tomcat6/target/store

To ensure that Ivory installation on your system uses the qa domain settings, just set the IVORY_DOMAIN value to 'qa' in your environment.

*Ivory logs
Once deployed, all the Ivory operations are logged in folder /var/log/ivory by default.
Application.log contains logs for all the ivory server operations, if Ivory is deployed in distributed mode then prism logs are populated in 
Prism.log
