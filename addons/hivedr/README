Hive Disaster Recovery
=======================

Overview
---------

Falcon provides feature to replicate Hive metadata and data events from one hadoop cluster
to another cluster. This is supported for secure and unsecure cluster through Falcon Recipes.


Prerequisites
-------------

Following is the prerequisites to use Hive DR

* Hive 1.2.0+
* Oozie 4.2.0+

*Note:* Set following properties in hive-site.xml for replicating the Hive events:
    <property>
        <name>hive.metastore.event.listeners</name>
        <value>org.apache.hive.hcatalog.listener.DbNotificationListener</value>
        <description>event listeners that are notified of any metastore changes</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>hive.metastore.dml.events</name>
        <value>true</value>
    </property>


Usage
------
a. Perform initial bootstrap of Table and Database from one Hadoop cluster to another Hadoop cluster

    Table Bootstrap
    ----------------
    For bootstrapping table replication, essentially after having turned on the DbNotificationListener
    on the source db, we should do an EXPORT of the table, distcp the export over to the destination
    warehouse, and do an IMPORT over there. Check following Hive Export-Import link for syntax details
    and examples.

    This will set up the destination table so that the events on the source cluster that modify the table
    will then be replicated over.

    Database Bootstrap
    ------------------
    For bootstrapping DB replication, first destination DB should be created. This step is expected,
    since DB replication definitions can be set up by users only on pre-existing DBâ€™s. Second, we need
    to export all tables in the source db and import them in the destination db, as described above.


b. Setup cluster definition
   $FALCON_HOME/bin/falcon entity -submit -type cluster -file /cluster/definition.xml

c. Submit Hive DR recipe
   $FALCON_HOME/bin/falcon recipe -name hive-disaster-recovery -operation HIVE_DISASTER_RECOVERY


Recipe templates for Hive DR is available in addons/recipe/hive-disaster-recovery and copy it to
recipe path specified in client.properties.

*Note:* If kerberos security is enabled on cluster, use the secure templates for Hive DR from
        addons/recipe/hive-disaster-recovery
