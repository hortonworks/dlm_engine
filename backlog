Bugs: (Must fix)
* In oozie workflow engine, findBundle filters on killed bundles. This can create issues if the bundle is killed because all instances are killed. Instead, we can check for missing bundle path - Shwetha
* use queueName from properties for parent wf. - Let us make queueName parameter as first class citizen if set, then we will use it for the launcher as well, else we fall back to default - Shaikh
* Updating feed/process with another cluster doesn't work – A simple solution would be just go through the regular update by detecting that update needs to be done. Ideally I would prefer that we don't touch the unaffected clusters. But that is going to fairly tricky. - Shwetha
* Clean up of Ivory TT logs from hdfs, also expose stats and meta path and add retention for it - Add a admin service to take care of some administrative tasks. Drive it through config values in runtime.properties - Shaikh
* Get Status should look at last materialization time – Need to additionally check if too many instances qualify. - Shwetha

Important Enhancements / Improvements  & Less Critical Bugs:
* optional process inputs – elext, by passing optional input as properties. - Shwetha
* deb fix for ivory stop - trivial - Nikhil
* late arrival,retention should be optional for feed – trivial (handle nulls to avoid NPE) - Shaikh
* process with latest and future EL exp not getting submitted to ivory - Shaikh, done
* GlobStatus in replication throws null when…. - trivial fix - Shaikh
* For feed, cluster type should be optional, partition expression is required only if there is a target and multiple sources – just validations … - Shaikh
* Number of expressions in Partition Expression are not equal to number of feed partitions - this may not be the case always - Shaikh
* we should use process's lib path - trivial - Shaikh
* add cluster properties into job.properties while creating bundle - trivial - Shaikh
* Feed to support clister specific data path - Shaikh

Deprioritized
* SLA tracking
* For CLI, client.properties shouldn't be mandatory
* JMS message is not sent if process has no output
* process should gate on partition
* retention to delete root path if all children are gone (till date part, not over it)
* stats path in the properties for process/feed. retention to clean up stats as well
* evaluate / build replication with a bulking factor
