Ivory 0.2.1 backlog:
* SLA tracking
* In oozie workflow engine, findBundle filters on killed bundles. This can create issues if the bundle is killed because all instances are killed. Instead, we can check for missing bundle path
* For CLI, client.properties shouldn't be mandatory
* late arrival,retention should be optional for feed
* process with latest and future EL exp not getting submitted to ivory
* JMS message is not sent if process has no output
* process should gate on partition
* use queueName from properties for parent wf.
* SharedLib copying should throw exception.
* GlobStatus in replication throws null when....
* For feed, cluster type should be optional, partition expression is required only if there is a target and multiple sources
* Updating feed/process with another cluster doesn't work
* Number of expressions in Partition Expression are not equal to number of feed partitions - this may not be the case always
* Clean up of Ivory TT logs from hdfs.
