= Cloud Replication

Beacon supports replication of HDFS/Hive data between underlying HDFS and cloud storage. The only cloud provider supported now is AWS S3.

:toc:

== Supported Cloud Providers
=== AWS
* Supported authentication types:
** Access key and secret key based
** Instance profile on VM instances
* Supported cloud storages:
** S3
* Supported https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html[cloud storage encryption types]
** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html[SSE-S3]
** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html[SSE-KMS]

== Cloud Credentials
Every cloud replication requires setting up cloud credentials entity in Beacon. A cloud credential contains the credentials used
to access the cloud storage. When this credential entity is created in beacon service, an ID is generated which should be
 used in replication policy for all cloud based replications.

Example cloud credential properties:

* Access key based cloud credential properties:
[source, properties]
name=access-key-cred
provider=AWS
authtype=AWS_ACCESSKEY
aws.access.key=<access key>
aws.secret.key=<secret key>

* Instance profile based credential propertis,
[source, properties]
name=instance-profile-cred
provider=AWS
authtype=AWS_INSTANCEPROFILE

Refer to link:BeaconRESTApi.adoc[REST API Documentation] for more details.

== HDFS Cloud Replication
Beacon supports replication of HDFS data from cluster to cloud storage and vice versa. The replication policy runs on
the cluster and either pushes or pulls the data from cloud storage.

==== Cluster setup
The cluster can be an on-prem or IAAS cluster with data on local HDFS. The cluster requires HDFS, YARN, Ranger, Knox and Beacon services.

==== Replication policy for HDFS to cloud storage replication
* Submit the cloud credential entity, see <<Cloud Credentials>>
* Submit the replication policy to the above cluster. The properties in the replication policy are:
[source, properties]
type=FS
sourceCluster=<cluster name>
sourceDataset=<source HDFS path>
targetDataset=<target cloud storage path like s3://<bucket name>/<folder>>
cloudCred=<cloud credential ID>
cloud.encryptionAlgorithm=<optional cloud storage encryption type - AWS_SSES3|AWS_SSEKMS, if the target has to be encrypted>
cloud.encryptionKey=<cloud storage encryption key if encryptionAlgorithm is AWS_SSEKMS>
frequencyInSec=<frequency>

The cloud encryption details provided above will be used by beacon to block replication of encrypted data to un-encrypted target.

* If cloud.encryptionAlgorithm is set, target data will be encrypted with cloud.encryptionAlgorithm (this will override any bucket level encryption configured).
* If cloud.encryptionAlgorithm is not set, target data will be encrypted with bucket level encryption configured.


==== Replication policy for cloud storage to HDFS replication
* Submit the cloud credential entity, see <<Cloud Credentials>>
* Submit the replication policy to the above cluster. The properties in the replication policy are:
[source, properties]
type=FS
sourceDataset=<source cloud storage path like s3://<bucket name>/<folder>>
cloudCred=<cloud credential ID>
targetCluster=<cluster name>
targetDataset=<target HDFS path>
cloud.encryptionAlgorithm=<optional cloud storage encryption type - AWS_SSES3|AWS_SSEKMS, if the source is encrypted>
cloud.encryptionKey=<cloud storage encryption key if encryptionAlgorithm is AWS_SSEKMS>
frequencyInSec=<frequency>

The cloud encryption details provided above will be used by beacon to block replication of encrypted data to un-encrypted target.

== Hive Cloud Replication
Hive stores its metadata in hive metastore, but the underlying data is stored in HDFS or cloud storage. So, in a hadoop
cluster with hive service, hive warehouse directory can be configured with either HDFS or cloud storage.

Beacon supports replication of hive DB from cluster with underlying HDFS to another cluster with cloud storage.
It uses push based replication where the replication job runs on the cluster with HDFS. Hive replication from cloud storage to HDFS is not supported.

Hive replication from HDFS based cluster to cloud storage based cluster requires the following:

==== Cluster setup
===== Source Cluster
The cluster with hive warehouse directory on local HDFS. This can be an on-prem cluster, or an
IAAS cluster with data on local HDFS. The required services are HDFS, YARN, HIVE, Ranger, Knox and Beacon.

===== Target Cluster
The cluster with data on cloud storage. The cluster minimally requires Hive Metastore, Ranger, Knox and Beacon Services.

1. Hive Data Locations -
Hive metastore requires these specific configurations to point hive data on cloud storage. Note that both
hive.metastore.warehouse.dir and hive.repl.replica.functions.root.dir should be configured in the same bucket.
[source, properties]
hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=<cloud storage>
hive.repl.replica.functions.root.dir=<cloud storage>
hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms=false


2. Cloud access credentials - When Hive metastore is configured with hive warehouse directory on cloud storage, hive will also require the credentials to
access the cloud storage. This can be setup with one of the following configurations,

* https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.6.4/bk_cloud-data-access/content/s3-auth-per-bukcet.html[Access key and secret key]
* https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.6.4/bk_cloud-data-access/content/s3-credential-providers.html[Access key and secret key in credential file]
* https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.6.4/bk_cloud-data-access/content/s3-temp-session.html[Session token]
* For IAAS clusters, setup instance profiles

3. Cloud encryption configurations - If the bucket is encrypted, setup the https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.6.4/bk_cloud-data-access/content/per-bucket-encryption.html[bucket encryption details]

Note that all these configurations can be set in hive-site.xml

==== Cluster Entity
===== Source Cluster
No changes

===== Target Cluster
The following minimum properties with the values from target cluster are required in target cluster properties:
[source, properties]
beaconEndpoint=
hive.metastore.uris=
hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=
hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms=false
hive.repl.replica.functions.root.dir=
hive.metastore.kerberos.principal=<only for secure clusters>
hive.cloud.encryptionAlgorithm=<encryption algorithm for hive warehouse bucket - AWS_SSES3|AWS_SSEKMS>
hive.cloud.encryptionKey=<cloud storage encryption key when the algorithm is AWS_SSEKMS>

==== Replication Policy
* Submit the cloud credential entity on source cluster, see <<Cloud Credentials>>
* Submit the replication policy on source cluster with the following minimal properties:
[source, properties]
type=HIVE
sourceCluster=<source cluster name>
sourceDataset=<source hive DB name>
targetCluster=<target cluster name>
cloudCred=<cloud credential entityid which contains credentials for cloud storage>
frequencyInSec=<frequency>
